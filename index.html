				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					The HTML markup language is nearly 30 years old and over its lifetime it is grown significantly in
					complexity. However, at the same time web professionals have often skipped over learning basic HTML
					first in favor of immediately exploring design or programming frameworks. While such a choice would
					seem appropriate to get hands on experience, skipping markup basics can be limiting resulting in
					confusion or even . It is our hope that by approaching HTML using it is understandable that we would
					want to get things done.

				<h3><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#comments">Comments</a></h3>

				<p class="syntax">HTML comments are the form of <code>&lt;!-- an HTML comment --&gt;</code>.</p>
				<!-- an HTML comment -->

				<p class="warning">With HTML comments be careful with embedding the -, !, &gt; and &lt; characters.</p>

				<p class="tip">HTML comments are useful for documenting features, showing authorship</p>

				<p class="warning">HTML comments are seen by anyone who looks at the page source as such page authors
					are warned to
					avoid putting sensitive information in them or to strip the comments during a <a
						href="">minification</a>
					process.</p>

				<p class="tip">HTML comments can be used to insert content that is inert and have it extracted using
					JavaScript. The
					use of <code>data-*</code> attributes, a <code>template</code> element or string literals or other
					data format
					within a <code>script</code> block is a preferred way to embed such data payloads.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#character-references">Character
						Entities</a></h3>
				<p>A few example entities are &lt; (less than &amp;lt;), &gt; (greater than &amp;gt;, &amp; (ampersand
					&amp;amp;, &copy; (copyright &amp;copy;) and numeric entities like &#9786; (a unicode smile). Many
					many entities exist the main point is to understand the syntax and look up the symbol needed.</p>

				<h4><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-root-element">The Document
						Element</a></h4>
				<p>The <code>html</code> element surrounds the complete document and is the root of the parse tree.</p>
				<p>The two allowed elements within the <code>html</code> element are the <code>head</code> element where
					we keep information about the page and its content and the <code>body</code> element which contains
					the actual content itself.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#document-metadata">The Document
						Metadata</a></h4>

				<p>The <code>meta</code>tag will be found in the head which is often used to set the character set of
					the document which should be the first thing set. (See the head of the document) The
					<code>meta</code> tag also can be used to set keywords, simulate the equivalent of HTTP response
					headers and other configuration duties.
				</p>
				<p>The <code>head</code> should contain a <code>title</code> tag which is the only mandatory HTML
					element for a document. The title should be set to a descriptive value as it is used in book marks
					and search.</p>
				<p>The <code>head</code> may also contain a variety of <code>link</code> tags which may be used to
					asscoiated a style sheet or define various navigational relationships. The style of this <span
						class="externalExample">element was set by an exeternal style sheet</span>. We also can use a
					<code>style</code> element in the <code>head</code> itself. This <span
						class="internalExample">element style was set by an internal style block</span>. The global
					attribute <code>style</code> also set <span style="background-color: lime;">style information
						inline</span>. The choice between linked, document wide, or inline style varies based upon
					interest in performance and maintainability. Generally you are encouraged to separate concerns as
					much as possible.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html">Sections</a></h4>
				<p>The content of the page will be found in the <code>body</code> element.</p>
				<p>If the content or portion of the content is a stand-alone unit of content as an article it should be
					found within the <code>article</code> element. Look at line 35 this document is a complete article.
					Notice it is found in the <code>main</code> element as well. There is some degree of confusion
					around <code>main</code>, <code>section</code> and <code>article</code> in terms of encapsulation so
					be aware of how you might use them.</p>
				<p>The <code>section</code> element has been used heavily in the document as is used to break up content
					in chunks. It is a bit more semantic than <code>div</code> which is even more generic.</p>
				<p>Navigation items particular for site or section navigation should be found within a <code>nav</code>
					element as the "navbar" above demonstrates.</p>
				<p>The next element is wonderful for non-linera thinkers lie me.</p>
				<aside>
					The Professor really <em>loves</em> <code>aside</code> tags and asides in general as they tend to
					reveal the non-linear thinking patterns which can lead to interesting insights.
				</aside>
				<p>Headings ranging from <code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code> should be used to outline content. The
					document has been using them agressively, but as a sample here are the headings repeated.</p>
				<section>
					<h1>Heading 1</h1>
					<h2>Heading 2</h2>
					<h3>Heading 3</h3>
					<h4>Heading 4</h4>
					<h5>Heading 5</h5>
					<h6>Heading 6</h6>
				</section>
				<p>Headings can be grouped together using the <code>hgroup</code> element to limit the outlining
					function.</p>
				<section>
					<hgroup>
						<h1>Heading</h1>
						<h2>Subheading</h2>
					</hgroup>
					<p>The headings above are treated as a single unit while the headings below are treated as two
						units.</p>
					<h1>Heading</h1>
					<h2>Subheading</h2>
				</section>

				<p>When creating sections you may wish to specify the <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code>. This
					sectioning elements can appear for the whole document or individually within sections.</p>

				<section>
					<header>Header</header>
					<p>Section body</p>
					<footer>Footer</footer>
				</section>

				<p>A special section element <code>address</code>is often <a href="#address_element">found at the bottom
						of the document</a> that sets the contact information or address of the organization responsible
					for the document.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html">Grouping Content</a></h3>
				<p>A variety of content grouping elements are found in HTML. The most commonly used is the generic
					<code>div</code> element. A more meaningful element <code>p</code> is used to deliinate <a href="#"
						onclick="window.location='https://ucsd.edu">go to foo</a>paragraphs.
				</p>

				<p id="foo">When breaking apart sections we may wish to employ the void element <code>hr</code> to
					insert a
					horizontal rule like so.</p>
				<hr />
				<p>A <code>blockquote</code> element is useful to to quote large amounts of content. A smaller quotation
					should be placed inline using a <code>q</code> element.</p>

				<blockquote>
					Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy
					lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
					<cite>The <a id="word3">Hitchhiker</a>'s Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams</cite>
				</blockquote>

				<p>HTML supports a variety of list elements including both unordered (<code>ul</code>) and ordered
					(<code>ol</code>) lists. In either list case individual items are specificed using the list item
					(<code>li</code>) element. A specialized definition list is often used in glossary style lists and
					uses the <code>dt</code> (definition term) and <code>dd</code> (definition) within a <code>dl</code>
					definition list.</p>


				<ul>
					<li>Unordered 1
						<ol>
							<li>Ordered 1</li>
							<li>Ordered 2</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Unordered 3</li>
					<li>Unordered 4</li>
				</ul>

				<dl>
					<dt>Dingus</dt>
					<dd>A fake word for a gadget or doo-dad.</dd>
					<dt>Widget</dt>
					<dd>A fake word like a dingus or gadget</dd>
				</dl>


				<p>A specialized <code>menu</code> element is supposed to be employed when the items are interactive as
					shown here.</p>
				<menu>
					<li><button onClIcK="alert('New document')">New</button></li>
					<li><button onclick="alert('Open document')">Open</button></li>
					<li><button onclick="alert('Quit')">Quit</button></li>
				</menu>

				<p>When source code or other preformatted content should be include and white space should be preserved
					use the <code>pre</code> tag</p>
				<pre>
					let school = 'UCSD';

					/**
					 * helloJSWorld - the prototypical example complete with opinoniated mistakes!
					 */
					function helloJSWorld() {
					  // say hello as one would

					  alert(`Hello World students at ${school}!`);
					} /* helloJSWorld */

					helloJSWorld();
				</pre>

				<p>A figure is a semantic way to insert something like a chart or picture.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="./images/chart.png"

					<figcaption>HTML Element frequencies circa 2019</figcaption>
				</figure>


				<div>
					<p>Some of the most used and abused tags in HTML are clearly <code>div</code> and <code>span</code>.
						The <span>really don't mean much</span> and are just used to <span>group items and
							<em>elements</em> together</span> for some author defined purpose.</p>
					<p>In years past pundits would bemoan the lack of semantics that table laden sites exhibited. It
						seems in the modern area we don't worry about that and just put <code>div</code> or
						<code>span</code> around it
					</p>
					<div>
						<div>I could have been a <span>contender</span>! Yet without anything else I am just a plain old
							block or inline box.</div>
						<div class="jumbotron hero slide">Who knows maybe with some classes and a framework I'll get
							some style and action!</div>
						<div>
							<div class="warn">Careful!</div>
							<div class="msg">You can easily start getting a <div class="danger">chronic case of <div
										class="inner">Divitis</div>
								</div>
								<div>It sure looks semantic <div class="a1 b2 c3">but it </div> reall <div
										class="as3432424 as42312">isn't!</div> No where have I seen delicious markup
									like this? <div>Don't over <em>react</em> it is a truthful point, just few your
										rendered source and enjoy the result as well as potentially nasty SEO,
										performance and a11y penalties unless you do even more work.</div>
									<div>Use the platform isn't just a JavaScript rallying cry it works for markup too!
									</div>

				<h3>Text Level Elements</h3>
				<p>There are <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html">many inline text
						elements</a>. Things get a little iffy here for HTML novices because the default renderings can
					encourage you to think presentationally as opposed to semantically. Resist the pull to the dark side
					of markup and keep things logical applying look later with CSS!</p>

				<h3>Table Time!</h3>
				<p>HTML tables used to be the backbone of design, today they are back to their normal use. Given that
					data powers our world we should (re)discover what features HTML tables provide and then and only
					then turn to libraries to help us present data in a tabular manner. Understand that if we want to
					interact with data we call that a <em>datagrid</em> which is a different thing all together. For now
					datagrids are not native in HTML, but libraries like <a
						href="https://handsontable.com">Handsontable</a> and <a href="https://zinggrid.com">ZingGrid</a>
					can certainly address that.</p>

				<h3>Form Fun</h3>
				<p>Intearctive forms in HTML initially solely powered posting data to server-side programs. Today forms
					are used to power complex client side applications written in JavaScript. Much of the markup
					complexity is found with the <a

					<h3>Interaction is Coming</h3>
					<h4>Framework based, custom-elements, or plain old HTML declarative widgets will rule the 2020s</h4>
				</hgroup>
				<p>HTML 5 started a trend with richer form fields and a <a
						href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#interactive-elements">few
						interactive elements</a> but likely we will see most UI widgets move away from a collection of
					&lt;div&gt;tags and scripts to more obvious declaritive elements. The specification already supports
					<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements">custom
						elements</a> so we can do this easily enough even without a framework.
				</p>
				<h4>Details Demo</h4>
				<details>
					<summary>Click to see important details</summary>
					<ul>
						<li>Important detail</li>
						<li>Other important detail</li>
						<li><em>Most</em> important detail</li>
					</ul>
				</details>

				<h4>Dialog Demo</h4>
				<dialog id="quoteDialog">
					<p>Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others - <cite>Postel's
							Law</cite>
					</p>
					<button onclick="document.getElementById('quoteDialog').open=false">Close</button>
				</dialog>
				<button onclick="document.getElementById('quoteDialog').open=true;">Open Dialog</button>

				<h4>Basic Script Tag Use</h4>
				<script>
					let msg = "significant worries";

					document.write(`On this day ${new Date()} you see a simple example showing how JavaScript and HTML can be freely intermixed, but there are <strong>${msg}</strong> when this is not understood which may result in render blocking and performance problems!`);

				</script>
				<h4>Custom Element Example</h4>
				<template id="hello-wc-template">
					<p>Custom Element Hello World this was in the shadow DOM, but I can still see the <slot></slot>
					</p>
				</template>
				<hello-wc>Light DOM</hello-wc>
				<script src="./scripts/webcomponent.js"></script>
				<h4>Canvas Example</h4>
				<canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="300"></canvas>
				<script>
					let canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
					let context = canvas.getContext('2d');

					context.strokeStyle = "black";
					context.lineWidth = 5;

					/* create a frame for our drawing */
					context.beginPath();
					context.fillStyle = "blue";
					context.moveTo(50, 20);
					context.arcTo(280, 20, 280, 280, 30);
					context.arcTo(280, 280, 20, 280, 30);
					context.arcTo(20, 280, 20, 20, 30);
					context.arcTo(20, 20, 280, 20, 30);
					context.stroke();
					context.fill();

					/* draw circle for head */
					context.beginPath();
					context.fillStyle = "yellow";
					context.arc(150, 150, 100, 0, Math.PI * 2, true);
					context.fill();

					/* draw the eyes, nose and mouth */
					context.beginPath();
					context.moveTo(80, 110);
					context.bezierCurveTo(95, 85, 115, 85, 130, 110);
					context.moveTo(170, 110);
					context.bezierCurveTo(185, 85, 205, 85, 220, 110);
					context.moveTo(155, 130);
					context.quadraticCurveTo(130, 145, 155, 155);
